Implement a game of diceYou are being asked to design and implement a simple game of dice with two players—a human player and a computer-controlled player. The rules are as follows: 1.The game is divided into “rounds.” During each round, each player gets one “turn.”2.On a turn the player rolls two six-sided dice.3.The player wins the round that gets a double (or higher double if both get doubles). If neither player gets adouble then the higher total wins. If they both have the same total, then the player with the highest number on adie wins. If they both rolled the same numbers on their dice, then the round is a draw and neither player gets apoint.4.On the next round the two players switch turns, i.e. the second one to roll becomes the first one to roll and viceversa.5.The rounds continue until the human player decides to quit.6.Record information into a relational database, such as sqlite, and create queries which answer the followingquestions:1.How many rounds are played on average per game?2.For how long does the average game last?3.For each game, who won the most rounds?4.What is the percentage breakdown of each roll combination, i.e. 2.7% (1,2), 2.7% (1,3) foreach player?Now, before you go off and implement this game realize there is one catch, the computer player must have a winning average close to 70% but this game of “cheater’s dice” should still appear “almost” random and thus fair to the human player every time it’s played. So while the game may not follow the above list of rules exactly, it should appear to the player that it does. Provide a short description and then implement the game. You will not receive full credit without an explanation of how the computer cheats and why it still appears fair.
